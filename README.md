# EvoSim-NeuralCreatures
A simulation environment for evolving creatures with neural networks, exploring genetic algorithms, and emergent behaviours.

## Visualising the world

Run `python src/Python/simulation/environment.py` to view the grid produced by
the C simulation.  The viewer now draws simple emojis, grid lines and a legend
so it's clear where food, poison, water and creatures are located.  After the
image is shown a short sentence is printed describing what each creature is
doing.
